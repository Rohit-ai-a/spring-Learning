# Spring Learning Journey

Welcome to my Spring framework learning repository. Here, I'll be documenting my progress, sharing code snippets, and writing down my learnings and reflections.

## Objectives

- Understand the core components of the Spring framework.
- Implement practical exercises to solidify concepts.
- Build sample projects to demonstrate understanding.

## Learning Plan

1. **Introduction to Spring**
   - Overview of Spring Framework
   - Environment setup

2. **Spring Core**
   - Inversion of Control (IoC)
   - Dependency Injection (DI)

3. **Spring AOP**
   - Aspect-Oriented Programming concepts
   - Practical AOP examples

4. **Spring MVC**
   - Building web applications with Spring MVC
   - RESTful services with Spring

5. **Spring Boot**
   - Simplifying Spring application setup
   - Creating standalone applications

**What I learned:**
- Spring Core:
-    * Firstly, Spring is a Dependency Injection Framwork to make Java Applications loosely coupled.
     * Spring provides IOC (Inversion of Control) for Dependencies.
     * Spring framework makes the easy development of Java EE-applications.

- Dependency Injection:
-    * It is design Pattern.
**Code Snippets:**
```java (What is dependecy Injection via example)
// Example code snippet
=====================================================================================================
class Ramu
{
   Geeta ob;
   public Static void doWork()
   {
      System.out.println("Here Ramu is Totally depnds on the Geeta");
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
class Geeta
{
public void doWork()
   {
      System.out.prntln("If Ramu class get called then it automatically call the getta's class")
   }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//**__So what we learn from the samll code, there is class of Ramu which is totally depends on the Geeta class.
  // #) It crates object of class and Inject it to the another class.__**
